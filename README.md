Lexer (P1):
  Beginning of construction for compiler named cronac for the custom C-rona langauge. 
  The first component of the compiler built this semester is the scanner, consisting of the lexer which generates tokens that are then utilized by the parser. Project-1 is a lexical analyzer called FLEX (Fast lex) we scan a text file character by character creating tokens for each syntactic component in the C-rona  language.
  
Parser (P2):
  Project 2 builds on the lexical analyzer and token generation completed in Project 1 by using the Bison parser with specific CFG to evaluate the structure of the code being analyzed.
